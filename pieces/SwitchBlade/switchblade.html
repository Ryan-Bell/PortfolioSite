				<h3>I created this game with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thenelsonscott">Nelson Scott</a>,
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hawkdanny">Daniel Hawk</a>, and
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petertlockhart">Peter Lockhart</a> during my Freshman year of college.
				It was made in C# with Monogame and revolved around the concept of following a sword as it changes hands 
				during battle.

				<h3>The game had a custom character creation feature and special abilities specific to 
					each of the four factions. My main role was with the map generation which was completely
					procedural.

				<h3>The map creation process included my own implementation of Perlin noise.
					This was used to blend two background textures as well as creating the 
					edges of the pathways. Placement of objects and the setting of collision
					boxes was also done on startup through code.
