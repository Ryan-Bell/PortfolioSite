				<h3>This is  a music visualizer that I made in Processing. It 
					starts out by showing the title coming into focus with the 
					use of Guassian blur. The title can be changed in the code 
					and is composed of small dots of varying size and color. 
					The dots are placed randomly based on a alpha mask of the 
					title which is generated on startup.  
				</h3>	
			</div>
			<div class="largerow">
				<img src="Capture4.PNG"   alt="title exploded" />
				<h3>The dots also have physics functions which allow forces
					to be applied to them. Using these functions, the title
					is disintegrated and the main visualizer is faded in. 
				</h3>	
			</div>
			<div class="largerow">
				<img src="Capture2.PNG"   alt="waveforms" />
				<h3>The main music visualizer shows the waveform for the song
					at the top and the bottom as well as a large, stationary
					dot in the middle which pulsates based on the minim beat
					detection algorithm.
				</h3>	
			</div>
			<div class="largerow">
				<img src="Capture3.PNG"  alt="spectrograph" />
				<h3>A spectrograph is also shown on the right and dots
					move from right to left in the background at different
					rates to give an illusion of movement. The dots differing
					size and speed make it look as if the large dot is floating
					through space. 
				</h3>	
			</div>
			<div class="largerow">
				<img src="Capture5.PNG"   alt="id3 tags" />
				<h3>At the end of the song, the ID3 tags are pulled and 
					information such as the song title, author, album
					and duration are shown.
