					This is an adaptation of the classic game Asteroids that I made in processing and 
					later converted to javascript. In this version of the game, the asteroids have 
					been replaced by cells that grow and eventually split. The player avoids the 
					cells with their ship and can force the cells to split by shooting them. If a cell
					splits and is too small, it dies. The cells' outline is animated by moving control 
					points with perlin noise and drawing a curved line through these points.
