				<h3>This is a stylized render of the fifth level of a game that I made with a couple
					friends during my Senior year of high school. My main role during the game creation
					process was 3D modeling and AI programming. I worked alongside 
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritdanfisher">Dan Fisher</a>,
					who was in charge of overall game assembly in Unity and programming and
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sjgarciap" >
					Sebastion Garcia</a> who made the concept art, textures, level design and story. 
					The game ended up qualifying for national competition. I then lost the file when
					my hard drive crashed.
