			<h3>Fixes from Project 2:</h3>
			<ul> 
				<li>The link on my 230 main page is fixed to actually point to the project
				now</li>
				<li>The copyright at the bottom of the page was changed from 2016 to 2015</li>
				<li>Navigation not intuitive issue was fixed by making the links highlight on 
				hover and making a bottom border for the page that is currently being viewed</li>
				<li>Tags were changed from divs with ids to header, main etc. </li>
				<li>Header height was reduced to make it not waste as much space (CRAP principles)</li>
				<li>Content was added especially in the about.html which was previously empty</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Added for this revision</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>DHTML example version of my projects page which can be found by following the link
					in portfolio.html. This DHTML example uses JQuery fadeIns and fadeOuts as transitions. 
				</li>
				<li>An image gallery can be found <a style="color:#ccc;" href="imagegallery.html">here</a></li>
				<li>SSI is used for the header and footer on each page and jquery is used to adjust the 
					header and nav links on most inheriting pages</li>
				<li>SSI command in the footer to display date</li>
				<li>custom 404 page created</li>
				<li>password protected page at <a href="https://people.rit.edu/rjb1928/230/portfolio/auth/myPage.html" style="color:#ccc;">this location</a>.
