				All of the html and css code in this project is mine. The design is
				influenced by a number of similar portfolio sites that I thought 
				looked good (although my site didn't turn out nearly as good as any
				of them). All pictures as also mine. The largest problem I faced was
				finding the time to do this project. The second was determining what
				layout I should go with for the site. The third was getting the site
				to stay responsive at different screen sizes. The first two can't 
				really be improved on or avoided that easily. The third will become
				easier the more that I work with web development. Just doing this 
				project has helped me learn how sites should be set up and organized
				on a more basic level so that making it responsive is easier.<br />
				For above and beyond, I put my version of the game Asteroids in the 
				site with javascript. -->
				Fixes from Project 2:<br />
				-The link on my 230 main page is fixed to actually point to the project
				now<br />
				-The copyright at the bottom of the page was changed from 2016 to 2015<br />
				-Navigation not intuitive issue was fixed by making the links highlight on 
				hover and making a bottom border for the page that is currently being viewed<br />
				-Tags were changed from divs with ids to header, nav etc. <br />
				-Header height was reduced to make it not waste as much space (CRAP principles)<br />
